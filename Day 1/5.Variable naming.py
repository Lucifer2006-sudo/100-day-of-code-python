#rules for naming the variable
#rule 1
'''in python we can name variables accord to our convinence ass it does not
 affects the code but we can not add space in between the name''' 
 # if we do so the code turns out to be in vallid
 # To seperate the words we use _ --aka-- under score for e.g:

lenght_of_the_person = input("what is your height ?")
print(lenght_of_the_person)
#rule 2
'''we can add number in the name of var but not at the begining 
of the name only after writing the first alpahabet'''

#rule 3 or can say it as as a tip
''' dont use some previlege names like print,input or any 
name which exists as a variable or an default name. '''
